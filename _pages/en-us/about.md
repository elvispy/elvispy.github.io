I'm a PhD student in the [School of Engineering](https://engineering.brown.edu/people/graduate-students/phd-students/phd-students-fluids-and-thermal-sciences) at Brown University.  
Before coming to Brown, I completed an MSc in Applied Mathematics at [IMPA](https://impa.br/) under the supervision of [André Nachbin](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/anachbin)—a program I began at 17—and a BSc in Engineering Physics at [UNILA](https://portal.unila.edu.br/).

My work explores how mathematics and computation can illuminate complex physical systems. I build models that connect theory, simulation, and experiment to understand nonlinear behavior in fluids and soft materials. Current projects include [interfacial locomotion]({{ '/projects/3_surferbot/' | relative_url }}), non-Hertzian impact, and multiphase mixing in bioreactors for [alternative protein manufacturing]({{ '/projects/0_bioreactor/' | relative_url }}). These efforts combine high-fidelity simulation with reduced-order reasoning to bridge first-principles physics and emerging data-driven methods.

More broadly, I’m fascinated by how we learn and represent the physical world—across scales, from molecules to machines. This curiosity drives my interests in scientific computing, probabilistic modeling, and even the philosophical questions behind what makes a model “true enough” to be useful.

Outside the lab, I’ve worked with civic-tech organizations in Paraguay to advance transparency in public spending, and I continue to contribute to the Paraguayan National Math Olympiads as a problem author and trainer.
