I'm a first-year PhD student at the School of Engineering at Brown University, after having completed a MSc. in Applied Maths, kindly supervised by [André Nachbin](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/anachbin) at [IMPA](https://impa.br/), which I started when I was 17 years old, and also completed a B.S. in Engineering Physics at [UNILA](https://portal.unila.edu.br/)


I am broadly interested in the modeling and simulation of complex physical systems, with a focus on understanding, predicting, and eventually shaping nonlinear dynamics across natural and engineered environments. My curiosity spans computational engineering (both classical and probabilistic), learning algorithms, quantum computing, and the philosophical foundations of modeling itself. I’m drawn to these areas not only for their intellectual richness but also for their potential to enable meaningful applications from fundamental science.

Currently, my research lies at the intersection of fluid mechanics and soft matter physics. I develop reduced-order and interface-resolving models to study problems like wave-driven propulsion, non-Hertzian impact dynamics, and multiphase mixing in bioreactors for cultivated meat production. These projects combine theoretical modeling, simulation, experiments and physical insight to tackle challenges in biological manufacturing, interfacial transport, and fluid–structure interactions.

Outside of academia, I’ve collaborated with civic tech organizations to promote transparency in public procurement in Paraguay, and I continue to contribute to the Paraguayan National Math Olympiads.
