I'm a first-year PhD student at the School of Engineering at Brown University, after having completed a MSc. in Applied Maths, kindly supervised by [Andr√© Nachbin](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/anachbin)  at [IMPA](https://impa.br/), which I started when I was 17 years old, and also completed a B.S. in Engineering Physics at [UNILA](https://portal.unila.edu.br/)
          
My work focused in Computational Fluid Mechanics, where I strive to implement reduced order models to simulate complex flows. 

I have a wide and expanding set of interests, all of them inspired by an honest quest for truth and scientific rigor. Lately, I have been drawn by ideas spanning areas such as Computational Engineering (classical, deterministic and probabilistic), Learning Algorithms (both their foundations, scalability and safe implementation), Quantum Computing, and even Philosophy. 

On a non-academic note, I also had the pleasure to work alongside teams advocating for anti-corruption public policies in my home country (Paraguay), through implementation of Open Contracting Data Standards. I am also an avid collaborator of the Paraguayan National Math Olympiads.

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)
