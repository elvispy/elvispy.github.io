ReAcci√≥n aims to catalize community innovation against corruption using civic education, collective construction, strategic communication, and social technology to promote transparency and good governance, especially in the education sector.

You probably agree with me that transactions made by the government must be tractable and transparent. There are guidelines to achieve this goal, given by the
<a href="https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/"> Open Contracting Data Standards.</a>

Up until a couple of years, Paraguay had little to no infrasctructure on this matter. Public contracts were mainly scanned and their metadata were unavailable to the public.

We analyzed hundreds of contracts before the digitalization to show our government that there was demand for transparency among civil society.
After the first steps towards digitalization were taken, I authored a simple Google Scripts project that extracted the metadata of all public contracts in the period 2012-2019. From that data, a couple of <a href="https://reaccion.org.py/publicaciones/#investigaciones"> articles</a> were written.
