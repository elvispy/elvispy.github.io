Paraguay has a mediocre <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-long-run">mean years of schooling</a> when compared to other countries. To mitigate this, Paraguay's government offers full-tuition scholarships to pursue undergraduate degrees in our country for high-school students.
In order to qualify, students must met a minimum score in math and literature tests taken nationwide.
However, high-schoolers systematically fail to get the bare minimum to qualify for this scholarship, and sometimes hundreds of scholarships don't get awarded because of this. There's obviously a systematic flaw causing this issue. However, it's such a pity that all these scholarships never get awarded because most of these students come from underserved contexts.
