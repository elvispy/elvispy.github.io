Science Olympiads have reshaped the way I see the world.  
Through OMAPA, an NGO that invested in Science Olympiads when I was in high school, I was lucky enough to receive proper training and have another chance in life.
Several years have passed, now I'm ready to start a PhD and extremely enthusiastic to share with others what I've received. Since 2019, I mentor brilliant students at "Jovenes Talentos", a program that introduces
students to critical thinking and college-level math topics. If you are enthusiastic and have initiatives in mind to promote these kinds of projects, contact me!

If you ever wondered how to approach a new, challenging problem, <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf"> Polya's four steps </a> are always a safe pick to enhance your problem-solving habilities.
