    "summary": "I have a passion for scientific computing and applied math, with a background that includes an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and a B.Sc. in Engineering Physics. My work spans various projects in Python, C++, Java, Julia, and MATLAB, many of which you can find on my GitHub. Lately, I’ve been delving into Computational Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, and experiments in Magnetism, blending hands-on research with computational simulations.\n\nI’m naturally curious and love exploring new ideas, whether it’s the complexities of fluid flow, the mysteries of quantum physics, or even philosophical questions about the nature of reality. Beyond research, I’m deeply committed to education. I’ve spent over 1,000 hours volunteering with the Paraguayan Mathematical Olympiad, crafting challenging problems and helping students discover the beauty of math and science.\n\nI’m always excited to connect with others who share my passion for research, teaching, and pushing the boundaries of what we know.",

      "summary": "We study the axisymmetric impact of a rigid sphere onto an elastic membrane theoretically and experimentally. We derive governing equations from first principles and impose natural kinematic and geometric constraints for the coupled motion of the sphere and the membrane during contact. The free-boundary problem of finding the contact surface, over which forces caused by the collision act, is solved by an iterative method. This results in a model that produces detailed predictions of the trajectory of the sphere, the deflection of the membrane, and the pressure distribution during contact. Our model predictions are validated against our direct experimental measurements. Moreover, we identify new phenomena regarding the behaviour of the coefficient of restitution for low impact velocities, the possibility of multiple contacts during a single rebound, and energy recovery on subsequent bounces. Insight obtained from this model problem in contact mechanics can inform ongoing efforts towards the development of predictive models for contact problems that arise naturally in multiple engineering applications.",
